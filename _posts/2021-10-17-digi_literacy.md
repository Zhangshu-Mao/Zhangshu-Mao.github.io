I'd like to think with the information barrier being gradually dismantled, we are walking towards a more fair sociery. And people getting good at playing with their phones are very much related to the issue as it :

- paved the road towards a more equal distribution of education resources.
- allow people to express themselves more freely.
- provies a inclusive/open platform for people to divert attention to issues in real life.

With the help of online courses, the development of technology has (at least) flattened the information barrier, making resources available for everyone.

All while providing a more robust, interactive learning experience.

a large number of interactive activities enable everyone in the online classes to participate while if they were in a traditional classroom, only a few people can have a chance to interact with each other.
This enables students to take different approaches towards their goal.

It is worth noting that at present, most of the young people in this generation know their way around the internet, and they are proficient in using digital devices. 
That's to say their digital literacy is at a relatively competent level. 
This trait is especially prominent during the pandemic period, as we can see students creatively uses a various of methods to study via the internet.
Of course, this phenomena is also helped by the rapid advancement of many online learning platforms. 
With a fairly equal base knowledge of how to navigate yourself on the internet, the only thing left to do is to express your self.
In China, the popularity of the internet has made more and more people to express their opinions more or less freely on various platforms.

Many young people post their lives and opinions on social media and become bloggers or Internet celebrities.

Looking at the issue of gender equality, there are activities of "Girls Help Girls" on the internet. 
Some women released what had happened to her on the social media which echoed in the society.
As a result, those who have the courage to talk out have received unexpected help, such as monetary support, legal aid, emotional support. 
Little by little, these stories created a trend in society. 
In China, gender discrimination against women is gradually disappearing, and digital culture is playing a crucial role in reducing those inequalities.

However, there will still be some discordant places on the Internet. 
As Megan Bole wrote (1999):

> Without the critical dimension self-reflection can be 'reduced to a form of solipsism' (p 178). 

I am concerned at the fact that many people are spreading negative opinions under the guise of free speech. 

Will the younger generation need to be able to judge right from wrong and uphold correct values in the information age?
