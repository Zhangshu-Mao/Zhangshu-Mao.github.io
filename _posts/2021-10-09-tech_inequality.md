>digital inequality recognizes that peopleâ€™s socio-economic status influences the ways in which they have access to and use the internet.

Technology is like a magnifying glass. Not a normal one, but one that also magnifies itself.

<!-- We are bombarded by information every day, and we are very much accustomed to it.
We embrace information by spending hours after hours staring in to the endless flow of news/social media on our computer screen, to the extent that we are numb and unaware of it's existence.
However, we rarely stop and think: __Is the information we received biased? Is it associated to our social environment?__ -->

There is an interesting phenomenon: In my hometown, Hangzhou, where Alibaba is located, people are more accustomed to using  products from Alibaba, but in Guangzhou, where Tencent is based, people are more likely to use products provided by Tencent.
The same holds true of other software, where people in different regions have a preference for digital product choices.

This makes me wonder: __Can the information be biased? Is it associated to our social environment?__

## Extrinsic reason
Have you ever get the feeling that you are addicted to the internet?
Or have you ever feel that one app is sufficient to provide you with all the information you ever wanted?
Have you ever watched news and saw Trump supporters trending with tags like `A-holes` `stupid`?
But have you ever wonder: __why is that?__

Here's a scary thought: When we browse the web, the information that's being broadcasted to the internet from our devices includes every bits of of the "essence" that makes us, well, __us__.
It includes what food are we interested in, what cloth do we want to wear, what languages do we speak, what racial demographies are we in, and even our deepest desires.
Some people even argue that we are more alive on-line then off-line.

With that amount of information basically "free-roaming" on the internet, big _tech_ companies started to have some (not necessarily ðŸ˜ˆ) ideas.
With the development of artificial intelligence and "machine learning" (whatever that is...), companies like `Google`, `Microsoft` and `Apple` are slowly but surely getting some degrees of understanding of how we, as social beings, work.
And because they are driven by their share holders, they want to maximize their profit (capitalism at its finestðŸ¤ª).
And to them, there are two choices:

- <span class="blue">give easy-to-click suggestions to information containing ideas that are closer to user's.</span>
- <span class="red">give equal amount of coverage to all ideas regardless of the contents.</span>

And of course they choose the first one. After all, they are only multibillion dollar companies, losing a buck is for sure going to kill them, right? [sarcasm]

It is because of this decision, information is extrinsically biased by technology.
You'll (to a large extent) only receive information that's close to your interest or social circle.
If someone lives in a very different parts of the social circle than yours, they'll get in touch with drastically different information.

> The overall policy challenge is not to overcome a digital divide but rather to
expand access to and use of ICT for promoting social inclusion.
(Lawson-Mack 2001, p. 212, emphasis added)

Another degree of extrinsic inequality arises due to unequal physical access to internet.

The internet is a fantastic place. It spreads information at a speed that's never been (literally) heard before.
However, since it's a non-physical thing, we needs a physical media to connect to it.
To my surprise, my home country China only has about [:link: 70.4 percent](https://www.statista.com/statistics/236963/penetration-rate-of-internet-users-in-china/) (47th Statistical Report on Internet Development in China, page 17).
And if we take a look at the map of the [internet speed of the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-speeds-by-country), we see that inequality has profound impact on how we access the internet:

Overlapping this map with a [world map of GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?view=map):

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post_img/2021-10-09-img3.png){:height="80%" width="80%" .center}

We can clearly see that regions with lower GDP tends to have lower internet speed.

## Intrinsic bias
However, that's not the whole story.
We, as human beings, are intrinsically biased.
Those multibillion dollar conglomerates choose to take the blue pill because it satisfies their desire by satisfying our desire.
We don't want to hear ideas that are opposite to ours, and  that "inequality" is just baked into our minds.
Not many of us can overcome this what I considered to be a biological barrier, but the few of us that did do so tells us the only way to achieve it, is to be humble and try and put oneself into another one's chair.

We've built up a wall to ourselves that will only makes us sink deeper and deeper into our own social circles.
The algorithms of technology companies are using are merely fueling this phenomenon (like I said, in a sense, it only magnifies our own bias).
This negative feedback circle promotes information asymmetry and leads to social inequality.

---

## Other factors
People live in different regions of the world have different culture, speaks different languages.
Hence, they are basically forced to see certain information.
This is a barrier that has always been there, and will probably still be there in the foreseeable future.

---

## Are we even trying?
Of course! I'm not the only one who has realized this information inequality.
There are plenty of people who are trying to resist this negative feedback.
Open source community for example, is a very good start.
Taking Wikipedia as an example: It's a centralized information platform (in a sense that you only need to visit one webpage for all the information you need), but __everyone__ can edit it.
The knowledge base is expanded by providing editing rights to everyone.
But at the same time, it gives a space for people to talk about some topic and to merge their own opinion into the webpage.
This also enhanced the credibility of the information.
Although Wikipedia is not a perfect platform, but at least it's a start. (Please donate ðŸ’·.)
