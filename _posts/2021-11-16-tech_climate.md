In the face of the world's energy crisis, the United Nations' climate summit in Glasgow, which ended just several days ago, called for reducing carbon emissions from coal burning.
This reminds me of one of the three principles in the article “Computing within Limits”- “Question growth”. It states that poverty is widespread. Such social dysfunction, along with the burdens on ecosystems produced by our economic activity, suggest we must rethink our growth paradigm. I won’t discuss the outcome of this summit (since it’s an utter failure and shame on politicians that are “all talk and no action”), but it does send us a signal that we need to change the industrial development model.

In response to climate change and pollution, China has set a "double carbon" target (it has pledged not to increase carbon dioxide emissions until 2030, and then slowly reduce them after peaking). Following this target, as far as I know, many Chinese factories have started to limit their power consumptions. Unfortunately, I don't think this is a long-term solution in an era of capital dictated society. As Jevons paradox mentions, more efficient technologies often encourage greater use of resources, reducing or eliminating savings, in contrast of what we really want to achieve. As a result, we urgently need technological innovation, and China is now focusing on supporting professional and technical talents for carbon emissions management.

This article reminds me of an example: Countless people around the world are dreaming of getting rich by trading/mining cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin rose, so does the new market of mining machines and the so-called crypto-farms. Millions of mining machines used to mine cryptocurrencies have been produced in the past and shipped to low-cost regions (regions where electricity is cheap) around the world to "mine" without stopping 24 hours a day.

According to research by the Centre for Alternative Finance Research at the University of Cambridge, as of May 10, 2021, the annual electricity consumption of bitcoin mining worldwide is approximately 149.37 TWh. To put this number in perspective, it’s more than the annual electricity consumption of Malaysia, Ukraine and Sweden combined, and it's close to Vietnam, which ranks 25th in power consumption. Mining not only consumes a lot of electricity that could be saved for other things, it also increases carbon dioxide emissions. It produced 69 million tons of carbon dioxide last year, which constitute around 1 percent of the global emission, and is seriously endangering the goal of curbing the global temperatures raise by 2 degrees Celsius over the next 20 years.

Although more than 70% of the world's current mining facilities are in China, China is cracking down on the cryptocurrencies (for political, economical and environmental reasons). Multiple new source reports that, Inner Mongolia, a province in northern China, has completely cleared up its cryptocurrency mining facilities and has set up a platform for individual to report cryptocurrency mining operations.

Although the world is enforcing its’ “no-crypto” policy, the electricity usage by the mining operation is still at an alarming high level. Since efforts to limit the use of resources in any human system are notoriously challenging, we still have a long way to go.
