> Technology feels like a magnifying glass. Not a normal one, but one that also magnifies itself.

We are bombarded by a ton of information every day, and we are very much accustomed to it.
We embrace information by spending hours after hours staring in to the endless flow of news/social media on our computer screen, to the extent that we are numb and unaware of it's existence.
However, we rarely stop and think: __it is the information we receive biased?__

## Extrinsic bias
Have you ever get the feeling that you are addicted to the internet? Have you ever opened up Tiktok only to find yourself after several hours still swiping up and doing the "silly laugh" face? Or have you ever feel that one app is  ufficient to provide you with all the information you wanted? Have you ever watched news and saw Trump supporters trending with tags like "A-holes" "stupid"? I have. But have you ever wonder: __why is that?__

Here's a scary thought: When we browse the web, the information that's being broadcasted to the internet from our devices includes every bits of of the "essence" that makes us, well, __us__.
It includes what food are we interested in, what cloth do we want to wear, what languages do we speak, what racial demographies are we in, and even our deepest desires.
Some people even argue that we are more alive on-line then off-line.

With that amount of information basically "free-roaming" on the internet, big _tech_ companies started to have some (not necessarily üòà) ideas.
With the development of artificial intelligence and "machine learning" (whatever that is...), companies like `Google`, `Microsoft` and `Apple` are slowly but surely getting some degrees of understanding of how we, as social beings, work.
And because they are driven by their share holders, they want to maximize their profit (capitalism at its finestü§™).
And to them, there are two choices:

- <span class="blue">give easy-to-click suggestions to information containing ideas that's close to each user.</span>
- <span class="red">give equation amount coverage of all ideas regardless of the contents maybe to the end user.</span>

And of course they choose the first one. After all, they are only multibillion dollar companies, losing a buck is for sure going to kill them, right? [sarcasm].

It is because of this decision, information is extrinsically biased.
You'll (to a large extent) only receive information that's close to you interest or social circle. If you an other live on different parts of the social circle, you'll get in touch with drastically different information.

BTW, I won't talk about getting access to basic hardware to have a internet connection, that inequality is just too physical for me ‚òπÔ∏è.

## Intrinsic bias
However, that's not the whole story. We, as human beings, are intrinsically biased.
Those multibillion dollar conglomerates choose to take the blue pill because it satisfies their desire by satisfying our desire.
We don't want to hear ideas that's opposite to ours, that's just baked into our minds.
Not many of us can overcome this what I considered biological barrier, but the few of us that did do that tells us the only way to achieve it is to be humble and try and put oneself into another one's chair.
‚òπÔ∏è
We've built up a wall to ourselves that will only get deeper and deeper in our own circles, and the algorithms of technology companies are using are merely fueling this phenomenon (like I said, in a sense, it only magnifies our own bias).
This negative feedback circle promotes information asymmetry and leads to social inequality.

## Other factors
People live in different regions of the world have different culture, speaks different languages.
Hence, they are basically forced to see certain information.
This is a barrier that has always been there, and will probably still be there in the foreseeable future.

## Are we even trying?
Of course! I'm not the only one who has realized this information bias.
There are plenty of people who are trying to resist this negative feedback.
Open source community for example, is a very good first try.
Taking Wikipedia as an example: It's a centralized information platform (in a sense that you only need to visie one webpage for all the information you need), but everyone can edit it.
The knowledge base is expanded by providing equal editing rights for everyone.
But at the same time, it gives a space for people to talk about some topic and to merge their own opinion (fact) into the webpage. This also enhanced the credibility of the information. It's not a perfect platform, but at least it's a start.
