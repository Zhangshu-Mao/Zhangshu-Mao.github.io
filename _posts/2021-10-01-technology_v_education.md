Technology is evolving. There just isn't a way to deny it.

I was a primary school teacher for nearly 5 years before I decided to start my postgraduate study.
During my life as a student and teacher, I've experienced the power of technology innovation, or, in some cases, the lack thereof.

I remember vividly that during the time while I was a primary school student, the word __"PPT"__ wasn't known to everyone and teachers were still using chalk and black boards to get the most of their messages across.
I think it was around the time when I was in middle school, things went over a dramatic change.

It was around that time, every class, and I mean, EVERY one of them, start to use slides as it was fast, beautiful, and it was fool proof.
At the time, I didn't realize that we, the humanity, is rising to an new era - the Information era.
And I couldn't possibly have predicted that everyone would be swiping phones in about 10 years time (But I guess someone did, and that someone made a whole bunch of money inventing those tech. I'm looking at you Steve Jobs!)

Comparing to today's technologies that were used in classes, things are moving to a brand new direction as the internet slowly changes everything.
The classes are moved online, enabling students to learn whenever they feel comfortable.
The face-to-face meeting has been changed to Teams/Zoom meetings, and the assessments are exerting more and more social media characters.

Speaking of social media characters, this reminds me of a lesson with my students about how to describe "autumn".
Before the class, students are asked to film a vlog that demonstrate what autumn looks in their eyes and uploaded their video to a social media platform, just like what we do on Instagram. (Is instagram good for kids? Debatable, but definitely worth exploring.)

There is no doubt that the children were full on __hyped__ for the assignment.
They were very actively commenting on each other's vlogs as they get to feel the different perspectives of everyone's own image of this lovely season through __videos__.
And that was a really good experience for technology provides another way to enhance the peer interactions and help them grow a healthy social circle.

However, I also found that some students got a bit __too__ attracted to the social media platform and spent hours browsing it (Funny to say that we adults do the same thing, do we have more *self-control* than our youngsters? I guess that's a topic for another day.)
In the mean time, utilizing technologies also means teens or juveniles would have unlimited access to all sorts of information.
Some of which could be harmful for younglings (Remember QAnon? Yeah, kids would be eaten alive by those radical/negative information).
As a result, they might absorb loads of invalid and negative information and form a bad view on the world.

During the time, I found that the use technologies like slides, mini-lectures, iPads really needs to be carefully implemented/designed as it can acts as a double sided blade.
On one side it can provide students with a better learning environment and on the other side, it can cause damages that cannot be repaired.
In addition, in the era of big data, [:link: confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) can be magnified millions of times and unequal access to different viewpoints can leads to extreme bias.

I found that sociotechnical-change has penetrated deeply into the educational field and thatâ€™s why I'm really interested in finding out the best way to practice teaching with it.
As the form of technologies may look important, how we apply it to the education system matters even more.

I also hope to learn more effective technologies that I can put into work for my future classes.
